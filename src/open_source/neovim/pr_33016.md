# PR: fix opts.title behaviors of _make_floating_pop_size

> [PR: neovim#33016](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/33016) fixes [Issue: neovim#33009](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/33009)

## How I found it

Hanging around in issues.

## How to solve it

As the issue saying, we need to find out what the `_make_floating_pop_size` does. After travelling, I found that the `opts.title` works well as `string` and I don't know why it should be `[string,string][]`.

After talking with the issue author, I knew that the `vim.lsp.util.open_floating_preview` using `vim.api.neovim_open_win` underhood. So it should follow the parameters definitions.

So, it's so easy to solve that `_make_floating_pop_size` should consider `opts.title` could be `[string,string][]`.

## Solve it

I wrote the first version code and sent it.

```lua
if opts.title then
  local title = opts.title
  local title_length = 0
  if type(title) == 'string' then
    title_length = vim.fn.strdisplaywidth(title)
  else
    if title ~= nil then
      for i = 1, #title do
        title_length = title_length + string.len(title[i][1])
      end
    end
  end
  width = math.max(width, title_length)
```

This version used the wrong api `string.len` which calculates the wrong length of cjk characters. Used `vim.fn.strdisplaywidth` instead.

On the another hand, this implementation of this piece is not so elegant.

The `@luukvbaal` recommends a better version,

```lua
local title_length = 0
local chunks = type(opts.title) == 'string' and { { opts.title } } or opts.title or {}
for _, chunk in
  ipairs(chunks --[=[@as [string, string][]]=])
do
  title_length = title_length + vim.fn.strdisplaywidth(chunk[1])
```

It's more elegant!

Before requesting code review, I wrote a simple unittest following the old unittests,

```lua
it('considers [string,string][] title when computing width', function()
  eq(
    { 17, 2 },
    exec_lua(function()
      return {
        vim.lsp.util._make_floating_popup_size(
          { 'foo', 'bar' },
          { title = { { 'A very ', 'Normal' }, { 'long title', 'Normal' } } }
        ),
      }
    end)
  )
end)
```

Then, pushed it and requested code review.

After a while, `@zeertzjq` merged it.

## What I learnt

- It's no so hard to finish a PR to a big codebase that it look like.
