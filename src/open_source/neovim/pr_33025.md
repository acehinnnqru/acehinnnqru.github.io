# PR: set correct '] mark when pasting chunks

> [PR: neovim#33025](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/33025) fixes [Issue: neovim#32960](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32960)

## How I found it

Hanging around in issues.

## How to solve it

This issue was solved with several lines' change, but I had changed the implementation many times that I pushed about 20+ commits.

When I first pushed some code, `@zeertzjq` reviewed and comment some changes. I changed several times between two implementations which differed in the `if` branches.

After I finalized changes, `@zeertzjq` invited `@justinmk` to review. `@justinmk` rewised me to change some logic which is the same as the first version implementation.

I was changing between several implementations again and again.

Then I realized that I made a mistake that I didn't write a summary for the logic to make all the reviewers to know **why I impl it like this**. That's why when different reviewers would argued between those changes before.

Here is the merged version,

## What I learnt

1. You should summarize why you write it like this when there got several different implementations.
2. If you think you are right, you should make a brief and clear summary on your code.
