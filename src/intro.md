# Intro

I am a developer, full of passion to open-source community.

In a long time I spent most of my time working or hanging around. But recently, I sent several **small** code PRs to `neovim` and `golang/tools` that made me felt so great.

So I renewed my blog using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) with [catpuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/mdBook) theme, to write down what I have done or working on in my life.
